            <p><strong>Mihajlo Idvorski Pupin, Ph.D., LL.D. (Serbian Cyrillic: Михајло Идворски Пупин; 9 October 1858 –
                    12 March 1935)</strong>, also known as Michael I. Pupin, was a Serbian American physicist and
                physical chemist.</p>
            <p>Pupin is best known for his numerous patents, including a means of greatly extending the range of
                long-distance telephone communication by placing loading coils (of wire) at predetermined intervals
                along the transmitting wire (known as "pupinization").
                Pupin was a founding member of National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) on March 3, 1915,
                which later became NASA. </p>
